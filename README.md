# Hawaii-Climate-Analysis-SurfsUp-with_SQLAlchemy
In this project, I analysed and explored the climate of Honolulu, Hawaii using Python, SQLAlchemy, Pandas, and Matplotlib. The goal was to help with trip planning by conducting a climate analysis of the area.

## Project Overview
I divided the project into two main parts:

### Part 1: Analyze and Explore the Climate Data

I used Python and SQLAlchemy to connect to the SQLite database and reflected the tables into classes.
I performed a precipitation analysis to get the previous 12 months of data.
I performed a station analysis to calculate the total number of stations and find the most active station.

#### Part 2: Design a Climate App

I designed a Flask API based on the queries developed in Part 1.
I created static routes for precipitation, stations, temperature observations, and two other dynamic routs for specified date ranges.

## Deployment

I deployed the project to a GitHub repository, and it includes the necessary files for analysis and app development.

## Acknowledgements

This project uses climate data from the Global Historical Climatology Network-Daily Database, which has been converted to metric units in Pandas.
